        "\n",
        "Chain of thought prompting for LLMs involves providing a sequence of reasoning steps in the prompt to guide the model toward a solution. This technique helps the model to process complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps, much like a human would. By mimicking human-like reasoning, chain of thought prompting improves the model's ability to handle tasks that require logic and deduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Wei et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) (2022) introduced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which uses steps to help solve complex problems. By adding few-shot prompts, it works even better for tasks that need careful thinking before answering, giving the model time to \"think.\" This can simply be achieved as prompting or instructing the LLM to \"Let's think through this step and step. Solve each step and explain how to arrived at your answer.\" These instructions eliminate the need to explicitly provide \"few-shot\" examples. This combination helps in tackling more difficult tasks effectively.\n",

        "A: ## Ambiguity in the Problem Statement:\n",
        "There is one main ambiguity in the problem statement:\n",
        "**Total volume vs. Number of servings:** The statement \"18 total cups of this drink\" could be interpreted in two ways:\n",
        "  * **18 cups of the combined volume:** This would mean Abigail used a total of 18 cups of liquid, including both iced tea and lemonade.\n",
        "  * **18 individual servings:** This would mean Abigail made 18 individual drinks, each containing 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 1/4 cup of lemonade.\n",
        "Let us assume the interpretation \"18 cups of the combined volume\".\n",
        "## Solution assuming 18 cups of combined volume:\n",
        "**Step 1: Find the proportion of lemonade in one drink:**\n",

Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n",
